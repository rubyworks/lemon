## DESCRIPTION

Lemon is a Unit Testing Framework that enforces a strict test structure mirroring the class/module and method structure of the target code. Arguably this promotes the proper technique for low-level unit testing and helps ensure good test coverage.

The difference between unit testing and functional testing, and all other forms of testing for that matter, is simply a matter of where the testing *concern* lies. The concerns of unit testing are the concerns of unit tests, which, in object-oriented design, drills down to individual methods.

**IMPORTANT!** As of v0.9+ the API has changed. The `unit :name => "description"` notation is no longer supported.


## EXAMPLE

Lemon tests are broken down into target class or module and target methods.
Within these lie the actual tests.

Let's say we have a script 'mylib.rb' consisting of the class X:

``` ruby
class X
  def a; "a"; end
end
```

An test case for the class would be written:

``` ruby
covers 'mylib'

testcase X do

  setup "Description of setup." do
    @x = X.new
  end

  method :a do
    test "method #a does something expected" do
      @x.a.assert.is_a? String
    end

    test "method #a does something else expected" do
      @x.a.assert == "x"
    end
  end

end
```

The `covers` method works just like `require` with the exception that it records the file for reference --under certain scenarios it can be used to improve test coverage analysis.

The setup (also called the *concern*) is run for every subsequent test until a new setup is defined.

In conjunction with the `#setup` method, there is a `#teardown` method which can be used "tidy-up" after each test.

The `#unit` method is also aliased as `#methed` which is actually a bit more readable. Along with that there is `class_unit` and it's alias `class_method` for testing class-level methods. Also note that the test methods may be capitalized (e.g. `#TestCase'), if you prefer that style.

That is the bulk of the matter for writing Lemon tests. To learn about additional features not mentioned here, check-out the [User Guide](http://wiki.github.com/rubyworks/lemon).


## USAGE

### Running Tests

Tests can be run using the `lemons` command line tool.

    $ lemons test test/cases/name_case.rb

Lemon utilizes the RubyTest universal test harness to run tests, the `lemons test` command simply passes off control to `rubytest` command. So the `rubytest` command-line utility can also be used directly:

    $ rubytest -r lemon test/cases/name_case.rb

Normal output is typically a _dot progression_. Other output types can be specified by the `--format` or `-f` option.

    $ rubytest -r lemon -f tapy test/cases/name_case.rb

See [RubyTest](http://rubyworks.github.com/rubytest) for more information.

### Checking Test Coverage

Lemon can check per-unit test coverage by loading your target system and comparing it to your tests. To do this use the `lemons coverage` command.

    $ lemons coverage -Ilib test/cases/*.rb

The coverage tool provides class/module and method coverage and is meant as a "guidance system" for developers working toward complete test coverage. It is not a LOC (lines of code) coverage tool and should not be considered a substitute for one.

### Generating Test Skeletons

Because of the one-to-one correspondence of test case and unit test to class/module and method, Lemon can also generate test scaffolding for previously written code. To do this, use the `lemons generate` or `lemons scaffold` command line utilities. 

The `generate` command outputs test skeletons to the console. You can use this output as a simple reference or redirect the output to a file and then copy and paste portions into separate files as desired. The `scaffold` command will create actual files in your test directory. Other than that, and the options that go with it (e.g. `--output`), the two commands are the same.

To get a set of test skeletons simply provide the files to be covered.

    $ lemons generate lib/**/*.rb

The generator can take into account tests already written, so as not to include units that already have tests. To do this provide a list of test files after a dash (`-`).

    $ lemons generate -Ilib lib/**/*.rb - test/**/*.rb

Test skeletons can be generated on a per-file or per-case bases. By case is the default. Use the `-f`/`--file` option to do otherwise.

    $ lemon scaffold -f lib/foo.rb

The default output location is `test/`. You can change this with the `-o/--output` option.

Generating test case scaffolding from code will undoubtedly strike test-driven developers as a case of putting the cart before the horse. However, it is not unreasonable to argue that high-level, behavior-driven, functional testing frameworks, such as Q.E.D. and Cucumber, are better suited to test-first methodologies. While test-driven development can obviously be done with Lemon, unit-testing best suited to testing specific, critical portions of code, or for achieving full test coverage for mission critical applications.

### Test Directory

There is no special directory for Lemon tests. Since they are unit tests, `test/` or `test/unit/` are good choices. Other options are `cases/` and `test/cases` since each file generally defines a single test case.
